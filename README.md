## Overview
A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented by me in various languages. This repository serves as a resource for students and developers to learn and practice.

## Table of Contents
1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Trees
4. Sorting Algorithms
5. ...

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yahyamissaoui/Algorithms-and-DataStructures.git
cd Algorithms-and-DataStructures
```
### **_Install Dependencies_**
If your project has specific dependencies (like Python libraries), you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from Python.org.
For compiled languages like Java or C++, hereâ€™s how you can compile and run the code:

### **_Compiling the Code (For Java and C++)_**
#### **For Java:**
```bash
javac MyProgram.java
java MyProgram
```
#### **For C++:**
```bash
g++ -o MyProgram MyProgram.cpp
./MyProgram
```
### **_Running the Algorithms_**
To run the algorithms or data structures, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the desired file. For example, to run a Python algorithm:

```bash
python algorithms/sorting/quick_sort.py
```

#### **For C++:**
```bash
./path/to/compiled/program
```

### **_Contributing_**
If you'd like to contribute, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
